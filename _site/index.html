      <p>Hello! My name is Max Bender and titles are weird, but if I were to give myself one it would be a Jr. Principal Engineer? While listening to a random episode of <a href="https://www.arresteddevops.com/">Arrested DevOps</a> with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/silviabotros/">Silvia Botros</a> I heard this title that I had never heard before, a “Principal Engineer”. She explores it more <a href="https://blog.dbsmasher.com/2019/01/28/on-being-a-principal-engineer.html">in her blog post</a> but the short of it is</p>

<p><em>“[being a Principal Engineer] is far more strategic, it’s far more business oriented, it’s involving a lot more influence, being an influencer without having the management title.”</em></p>

<p><em>“[during the time becoming a Principal Engineer you] need to be a force multiplier. There was a clear transition from me writing code to teaching others how to write code that’s actually clean and doesn’t cause us trouble too fast down the line. One of the big parts of Principal Engineering in my mind is you teach more than you actually do yourself.”</em></p>

<p>Why I call myself just a Jr. Principal Engineer is because there are a lot attributes of what Silvia talks about that I was already doing in my day to day job, but not quite at the same scale. I have a lot of experience to gain in being an influencer, but at IBM I feel like I fit the role of the <em>force multiplier</em> pretty well.</p>

<p>Primarily, my work has been on CICD and DevOps solutions, but I often get this itch to create something new. <mark>Python</mark> is my go-to scripting language but I’m not afraid of a little <mark>Bash</mark> or <mark>Ruby</mark> if the use-case calls for it or I am trying to work with a library that requires the aforementioned (i.e <mark>Chef</mark>). The instant gratification of making websites and working with complex relational database setups is a puzzle that I relish. Using <mark>Flask</mark> and <mark>SQLAlchemy</mark> I have put together some complex websites as a consultant on the side. See the NexNest project as an example.</p>

</p><p>A big part of my voyage in OpenSource has been learning how to use CICD tools to build automation around a product. For me it was a necessity, because the tediousness of re-running builds had gotten to vast. Travis offers a free CICD mechanism hooked natively into GitHub and many of the projects I was looking at were using it in their pipelines.</p>

<p>Internally we had a <mark>Travis</mark> environment for x86 and ppc64le, but none for s390x. I was tasked with supporting Travis on Linux on Z and so began a month dive into the source code of Travis. With this we were able to enable a regression pipeline for the release for IBM Cloud Private (ICP) on Z, a <mark>Kubernetes</mark> offering by IBM.</p>

Written in <mark>PHP</mark> in a summer alongside working at the Marist College HelpDesk, this website was part of a research project that funded me to present at <a href="https://iated.org/inted/">INTED</a> in Madrid, Spain. Alongside two professors, I gave a presentation on using technology to enhance learning in an un-obtrusive fashion with a concentration in learning foreign languages.</p>

<p>Backed by a <mark>MySQL</mark> database this is where I learned a lot about security in the modern age of web-development. Certain vulnerabilities such as SQL Injections and XSS were ones that I focused on researching because I knew they were some of the more common avenues of attack. Looking back on it however I have already noticed some mistakes but I was happy with how it came out.</p>

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-9 col-print-12"><p class="quote">IBM produces and sells computer hardware, middleware and software, and provides hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology.
</p><p>At IBM I started on the zPET solution test organization which tests the mainframe in a full stack customer-like configuration. Shortly after I moved to a team called the Linux Center of Competence which focused on testing Linux on Z with a similar configuration as on zPET. Part of the teams mission was to remove excuses when it came to running software on Linux on Z.</p>

<p>To enable software on Linux on Z our team hosts multiple Kubernetes development clusters and an <mark>OpenStack</mark> environment supporting 30+ internal teams. However many of these teams have no Linux on Z experience so we built education modules to assist in onboarding. See the “Let’s Talk” section for some more information.</p>

<p>This was a manual process to onboard each of these teams and we quickly found we needed a better solution. IBM uses GitHub and Travis but up until this point you couldn’t run Travis builds on s390x. Our team was tasked with the mission to enable Travis on Z which opens up the door to the entire organization of 400,000 people. Internally we can now build our packages in regression on the mainframe with Travis and hopefully soon the public will be able to too! See “Travis on Z” for more information.</p>

<p>Through testing Linux on Z I got exposure to many technologies: <mark>Docker</mark>, <mark>Kubernetes</mark>, <mark>Ansible</mark>, <mark>Jenkins</mark> and <mark>Chef</mark> to name a few. This has been the perfect opportunity because <strong>I love to learn</strong> new things and have been told I have good knack at teaching what I have learned. Seeing that light bulb go off when explaining how to construct a Dockerfile, then using <mark>Travis</mark> to build that code via <mark>GitHub</mark> in regression is my favorite part of my job. <em>closely followed by figuring out that bug that’s been plaguing me all week</em></p>

We were on the phone or helping people in person and looking back on it this experience has strengthened my ability to interact with customers in the field at IBM.</p>
