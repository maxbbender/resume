  Hello! My name is Max Bender and titles are weird, but if I were to give myself one it would be a Jr. Principal Engineer? While listening to a random episode of [Arrested DevOps](https://www.arresteddevops.com/) with [Silvia Botros](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silviabotros/) I heard this title that I had never heard before, a "Principal Engineer". She explores it more [in her blog post](https://blog.dbsmasher.com/2019/01/28/on-being-a-principal-engineer.html) but the short of it is
  
  *"[being a Principal Engineer] is far more strategic, it's far more business oriented, it's involving a lot more influence, being an influencer without having the management title."*

  *"[during the time becoming a Principal Engineer you] need to be a force multiplier. There was a clear transition from me writing code to teaching others how to write code that's actually clean and doesn't cause us trouble too fast down the line. One of the big parts of Principal Engineering in my mind is you teach more than you actually do yourself."*

  Why I call myself just a Jr. Principal Engineer is because there are a lot attributes of what Silvia talks about that I was already doing in my day to day job, but not quite at the same scale. I have a lot of experience to gain in being an influencer, but at IBM I feel like I fit the role of the *force multiplier* pretty well.

  My job at IBM is to test software on Linux on Z and through that I got exposure to many technologies: <mark>Docker</mark>, <mark>Kubernetes</mark>, <mark>Ansible</mark>, <mark>Jenkins</mark> and <mark>Chef</mark> to name a few. This has been the perfect opportunity because **I love to learn** new things and have been told I have good knack at teaching what I have learned. Seeing that light bulb go off when explaining how to construct a Dockerfile, then using <mark>Travis</mark> to build that code via <mark>GitHub</mark> in regression is my favorite part of my job. *closely followed by figuring out that bug that's been plaguing me all week*

  Primarily, my work has been on CICD and DevOps solutions, but I often get this itch to create something new. <mark>Python</mark> is my go-to scripting language but I'm not afraid of a little <mark>Bash</mark> or <mark>Ruby</mark> if the use-case calls for it or I am trying to work with a library that requires the aforementioned (i.e <mark>Chef</mark>). The instant gratification of making websites and working with complex relational database setups is a puzzle that I relish. Using <mark>Flask</mark> and <mark>SQLAlchemy</mark> I have put together some complex websites as a consultant on the side. See the NexNest project as an example.

  If I were to point to a shining accomplishment these past two years it was my port of <mark>Travis</mark> to the Mainframe. IBM has long been interested in enabling CICD and automation tools to be used by Open Source communities and internally to compile and test packages on s390x. Internally we can now build our packages in regression on the mainframe with Travis and hopefully soon the public will be able to too!
