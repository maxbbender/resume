    At IBM I started on the zPET solution test organization which tests the mainframe in a full stack customer-like configuration. Shortly after I moved to a team called the Linux Center of Competence which focused on testing Linux on Z with a similar configuration as on zPET. Part of the teams mission was to remove excuses when it came to running software on Linux on Z. 

    To enable software on Linux on Z our team hosts multiple Kubernetes development clusters and an <mark>OpenStack</mark> environment supporting 30+ internal teams. However many of these teams have no Linux on Z experience so we built education modules to assist in onboarding. See the "Let's Talk" section for some more information. 
  
    This was a manual process to onboard each of these teams and we quickly found we needed a better solution. IBM uses GitHub and Travis but up until this point you couldn't run Travis builds on s390x. Our team was tasked with the mission to enable Travis on Z which opens up the door to the entire organization of 400,000 people. Internally we can now build our packages in regression on the mainframe with Travis and hopefully soon the public will be able to too! See "Travis on Z" for more information. 

    Through testing Linux on Z I got exposure to many technologies: <mark>Docker</mark>, <mark>Kubernetes</mark>, <mark>Ansible</mark>, <mark>Jenkins</mark> and <mark>Chef</mark> to name a few. This has been the perfect opportunity because **I love to learn** new things and have been told I have good knack at teaching what I have learned. Seeing that light bulb go off when explaining how to construct a Dockerfile, then using <mark>Travis</mark> to build that code via <mark>GitHub</mark> in regression is my favorite part of my job. *closely followed by figuring out that bug that's been plaguing me all week*

    While my time at the Help Desk wasn't the most glamorous, I valued it a lot. I was resetting passwords and helping people out with basic technology issues but during that I was gaining so much experience in talking with customers. We were on the phone or helping people in person and looking back on it this experience has strengthened my ability to interact with customers in the field at IBM.
