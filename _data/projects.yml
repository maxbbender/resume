    A Website made with love by @Max Bender and @Mike Mcginnis

    I had written a couple website with <mark>Flask</mark> in school, but wanted to learn more and read up on [Miguel Grinberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/)'s tutorial on Flask and was exposed to a new set of best practices. Approached with an idea for a rental website targeted at students we designed and implemented a website written in <mark>Python</mark>.

    The website was backed by a fairly complex database that featured notifications and recursive comments. <mark>SQLAlchemy</mark> handles most of the direct SQL queries the complex `JOIN`s. See the implementation here [https://github.com/maxbbender/nexnest/blob/master/docs/erd.pdf](https://github.com/maxbbender/nexnest/blob/master/docs/erd.pdf).

    Enabling the tool that enables the tools - on Linux on Z
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    A big part of my voyage in OpenSource has been learning how to use CICD tools to build automation around a product. For me it was a necessity, because the tediousness of re-running builds had gotten to vast. Travis offers a free CICD mechanism hooked natively into GitHub and many of the projects I was looking at were using it.

    Internally we had a Travis environment for x86 and ppc64le but none for s390x, and I was tasked with supporting Travis on Linux on Z. With this we were able to enable and support a release for ICP on Z, a Kubernetes offering by IBM, for our customers.
